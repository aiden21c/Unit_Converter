# Unit_Converter

This repository outlines the use of MATLAB in creating a Unit Converter tool through achieving a number of milstones.

__Milestone 1__ is a very basic unit converter which converts hard coded values to and from metric and imperial.

__Milestone 2__ extended milestone 1 by making the program more user friendly, through the inclusion of user input to 
enable users to convert any values they wish. This milestone also involved displaying instructions to the user on how 
to use the program.

__Milestone 3__ involved enabling the application to handle erroneous input and have full error checking on all user inputs,
as well as implementing a user defined function into the program script.

__The final milestone__ fully extended this unit converter, and involved creating a user friendly GUI which gives users full 
functionality to convert values between imperial and metric units, with full error checking.
